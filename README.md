# GOPH 420 - Inversion and Parameter Estimation for Geophysicists <br>
*Semester:* W2023
*Instructor:* B. Karchewski
*Author:* Emily Hill <br>

A repository for Lab 02 implementation of the Newton-Raphson method for surface wave dispersion <br>

Driver file is called driver.py <br>

Calling driver.py in python will produce the available graphs and results from the surface wave dispersion equation analysis through the Newton-Raphson method <dr>

Newton-Raphson implementation can be found in goph420-w2023-lab02-stEH\src\my_python_package\calculations
